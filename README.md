Instructions are given on the website. In simple terms, *My Lego Photo* takes a photo that you upload and then outputs a photo using 1 by 1 Lego plates using a dictionary of 17 different colours pieces that can be purchased on lego.com. Some photos work better than others due to the limited colours. Hopefully you can find an intriguing result. 

Details:
* Used node.js for all the back-end processing:
  - Incorporated OOP design, to make the code more user friendly to understand and scale for the future <br>
  - Thoroughly practiced good code design, commenting my code throughout <br>
  - Used efficient algorithms, like a hash table to optimize the run-time
* Used Git to manage my workflow
* Advanced my knowledge with HTML/CSS
  - Learned several different CSS attributes to organize and present my application <br>
  - Learned new elements in HTML to create a more elegant design.
