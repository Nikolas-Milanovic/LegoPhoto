Instructions are given on the website. In simple terms, *My Lego Photo* takes a photo that you upload and then outputs a photo using 1 by 1 Lego plates using a dictionary of 17 different colours pieces that can be purchased on lego.com. Some photos work better than others due to the limited colours. Hopefully you can find an intriguing result.
